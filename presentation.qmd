## Why we need interrupted time series: the "no control group" scenario

::: {.incremental}
- **Problem:** In many real-world scenarios, finding a credible control group to evaluate a policy is not feasible.
- **Example:**. Health care policies often affect all providers simultaneously, like changes in physician compensation or changes in guidelines.
- **Challenge:** Standard methods, such as before-after comparisons or interrupted time-series (ITS), may produce biased estimates because of poor prediction, poor forecasting, and simplification assumptions with panel data.

## With "`itsCausal`", we aim to deliver a set of recommendations for practitioners

::: {.incremental}
- **Key Idea:**
  - Interrupted Time Series are heavily used in real world evidence, public health, health services research, and health economics, and epidemiological research, but little guidance on how to use it.
  - Extend the limited "work-horse" model with a machine learning-based method to address the "no control group" scenario and better forecast the counterfactual
  <!--Problem: its targets one average effect -->
  <!--- No untreated units: forecast the counterfactual.-->
  - Tailored for panel data such as health insurance claims data, where the number of units is larger than the number of time periods.

<div class="small-space"></div>


- **How it works:**
  - Use machine learners and ensemble methods to train models on pre-intervention data.
  - Forecast onto the post-intervention period ("counterfactual").
  - Compare actual outcomes with predicted counterfactuals to estimate causal effects.
  - Aggregate results for the desired population and the desired time period.

<!--
- **Estimates:**
  - **Average Treatment Effects (ATEs):** Provides insights into effect for the population.
  - **Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs):** Provides insights into effect heterogeneity at a more granular level.

## `itsCausal` was born from the practical need for effective healthcare monitoring

::: {.incremental}

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
  - Monitor the effects of population-level interventions using rich (panel) claims data.
  - Example: **interventions against low-value care (Vit. D testing) in Switzerland**.

- Use of **ML learners** (random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks, catboost, lstm) with hyperparameters tuning.
- **Rolling-window** approach to make forecasts post-interventions, allowing for time-invariant and time-variant predictors.
- The effect is the difference between the observed and the forecasted value.
- **Simulations** of different data-generating processes show good performance.

## Benchmarking

<div class="middle-space"></div>

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
  - We benchmark our method with **experimental evidence**:

    -  Randomized controlled trial: Primary Care Physicians in Switzerland were sent an information letter combining professional norms and peer comparison feedback about vitamin D testing (@mueller2023rct)
    - ATE from `itsCausal` is within the 95% CI of the ATE from the RCT

<div class="small-space"></div>

  - We re-estimate our research on low-value care with `itsCausal` and find similar results.

## User's guide

- We offer researchers and industry analysts in Public Health, Health Economics, and Health Services Research recommendations for the implementation of interrupted time-series.
- We build tests and graphical representations of tests for the assumption of causal effects, especially for the "no-confounding" assumption.
- We implement ML learners and provide guidance on how to implement them.

## Conclusion
- **`itsCausal`:** A powerful tool for estimating causal effects without a control group.
- **Benchmarking** of our method with published research and experimental evidence.
- **User's guide:** Helps industry researchers for sound implementation of ITS in real world evidence, public health, health services research, and health Economics.

# Appendix

# Identifying assumptions for the causal effect in its

The following assumptions must hold (see @cerqua2024nocontrol):

  1. There are no hidden forms of treatment leading to different potential outcomes (**weak SUTVA**).
  2. **Additivity**
  3. **No anticipation and no confounding**
    - Absence of anticipatory effects of the intervention on the covariates and the potential outcomes
    - Future covariates do not affect current potential outcomes
    - Covariates remain unaffected by the policy in the post-intervention period (post-treatment exogeneity of the covariates)
  4. **Dynamic potential outcomes model**: the potential outcomes absent the policy (the "counterfactual") can be predicted using lagged values of the outcome and of the covariates.
  5. **Post-intervention non-linear multi-step-ahead model**: the counterfactual can be predicted for multiple periods ahead using lagged values of the outcomes until the intervention, conditional expectations of the outcome after the intervention, and the covariates.

<!--  the potential outcome absent the policy is a flexible function of the past lags of the outcome, the contemporaneous covariates, and the past lags of covariates. The error term is a zero-mean, uncorrelated error term following a generic distribution.
